 * \qmltype ShellSurface
 * \instantiates QWaylandShellSurface
 * \inqmlmodule QtWayland.Compositor
 * \since 5.8
 * \brief Provides a common interface for surface roles specified by shell extensions.
 *
 * This interface represents a Wayland surface role given by a Wayland protocol extension that
 * defines how the WaylandSurface should map onto the screen.
 *
 * Note: Even though this type contains a very limited API, the properties and signals of the
 * implementations are named consistently. For example, if you're only using desktop shell
 * extensions in your compositor, it's safe to access properties such as title, maximized, etc.
 * directly on the ShellSurface. See the various implementations for additional properties and
 * signals.
